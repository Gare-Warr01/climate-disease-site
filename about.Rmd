## What This Project Is

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
This website is the applied, public-facing portion of my final project for  
<strong>GEOG 3000: Climate Change in Science &amp; Society</strong> at Utah Valley University.  
The course examines climate change as both a <strong>physical science</strong> topic and a <strong>human, societal, and public-health issue</strong>.
</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
The site is meant to work like a guided story: starting with climate trends, moving into disease patterns, comparing the two, and then zooming in on Utah.
</p>

## Course Learning Focus

GEOG 3000 emphasizes:

- Understanding how climate science works  
- Exploring vulnerability, exposure, and unequal impacts  
- Analyzing real datasets and communicating findings clearly  
- Connecting climate change to health, society, and everyday life  

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
This project reflects those goals by taking a complex topic—<strong>climate and vector-borne disease</strong>—and presenting it in a way that is grounded in data and accessible to non-specialists.
</p>

## Why I Chose This Topic

As a biotechnology student, I’ve always been drawn to topics that sit at the intersection of <strong>science, climate, and public health</strong>.  
Vector-borne diseases—especially <strong>West Nile virus</strong>—depend heavily on environmental conditions such as temperature and moisture.

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
Studying how these patterns shift in a warming climate felt both scientifically meaningful and personally relevant.  
It also offered a chance to practice real-world data analysis that aligns with my long-term career path in science.
</p>

## A Capstone-Style Project

Although completed within a single course, this work was designed as a <strong>mini capstone</strong>:

- Identifying a real, socially relevant question  
- Collecting and cleaning climate and disease datasets  
- Building a reproducible workflow in R  
- Creating visuals that explain complex ideas simply  
- Designing a public-facing product others can navigate and learn from  

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
A separate written paper provides the full analysis, while this website focuses on <strong>communication</strong>—the part meant for students, instructors, and community members.
</p>

## Why Utah?

Utah is where I live and study, and it has unique climate patterns:  
long-term drought, sharp temperature swings, changing precipitation, and increasing heat extremes.

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
These conditions shape mosquito activity and influence West Nile virus risk.  
Including a Utah-specific section helps connect national trends to a local, familiar landscape.

## Tools and Skills Used

This project was built using:

- <strong>R</strong> for data wrangling, visualization, and analysis  
- <strong>R Markdown</strong> for combining text, code, and graphics  
- <strong>tidyverse</strong> packages for data cleaning  
- <strong>ggplot2</strong> for visualizations  
- <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> for hosting the site  
- Climate datasets from <strong>NOAA</strong>  
- Disease datasets from the <strong>CDC</strong> and related surveillance systems  

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
Completing the full workflow—from raw data to polished website—strengthened my skills in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Climate and health data analysis</li>
  <li>Data cleaning and quality control</li>
  <li>Building reproducible R workflows</li>
  <li>Visual communication of scientific results</li>
  <li>Designing a project that others can explore independently</li>
</ul>

## Where This Fits in My Path

This project sits at the crossroads of my coursework and my longer-term goals in science.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Taking GEOG 3000 and learning how climate science connects to vulnerability and justice.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choosing climate and vector-borne disease as a topic that links climate, health, and biotechnology.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Building this site as a <em>portfolio-style project</em> that shows I can go from raw data to a clear, public-facing product.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Carrying these skills forward into future work in biotech, research, or public-health-related data analysis.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-top:8px;">
In that sense, this website is not just a class assignment—it’s a piece of my broader training as a scientist and communicator.

## How to Navigate This Site

Each tab walks through part of the project:

- <strong>Climate Trends</strong> – long-term climate changes  
- <strong>Disease Trends</strong> – patterns across several vector-borne diseases  
- <strong>Climate–Disease Comparison</strong> – climate and disease side-by-side  
- <strong>Utah Focus</strong> – state-level climate and disease trends  
- <strong>How to Read These Graphs</strong> – help interpreting visuals  
- <strong>Methods</strong> – how the data were cleaned and analyzed  
- <strong>Reflection</strong> – what I learned along the way  

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
You can explore the pages in order or jump directly into the sections that interest you.  
If you ever feel unsure about a figure, the <strong>How to Read These Graphs</strong> tab is there as a guide.

## Project Limitations &amp; Transparency

This work reflects the scope of an <strong>undergraduate exploratory project</strong>.  
It uses publicly available data, simple methods, and focuses on <strong>patterns</strong> rather than predictions.

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
My goal is <strong>clarity and transparency</strong> rather than forecasting or policy-making.  
All code and steps are visible throughout the site to support reproducibility and honest interpretation.

## About the Author

My name is <strong>Garrett Warr</strong>, and I’m an undergraduate student at Utah Valley University studying <strong>Biotechnology</strong>.  
I’m interested in how climate, health, and the environment connect — especially how changing conditions influence diseases, ecosystems, and the communities we live in.

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
Alongside this project, my studies focus on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Public health and disease ecology</li>
  <li>Microbiology and molecular biology</li>
  <li>Data analysis and visualization</li>
  <li>Climate science and environmental change</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
I enjoy building clear, visual, reproducible work using tools like <strong>R</strong>, <strong>ggplot2</strong>, and <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>.  
This project is part of my broader goal to grow as a scientist who can communicate complex ideas simply and effectively.
