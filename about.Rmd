This website is the applied, public-facing portion of my final project for  
<strong>GEOG 3000: Climate Change in Science & Society</strong> at Utah Valley University.  
The course examines climate change as both a <strong>physical science</strong> topic and a <strong>human, societal, and public-health issue</strong>.

## Course Learning Focus

GEOG 3000 emphasizes:

- Understanding how climate science works  
- Exploring vulnerability, exposure, and unequal impacts  
- Analyzing real datasets and communicating findings clearly  
- Connecting climate change to health, society, and everyday life  

This project reflects those goals by taking a complex topic—climate and vector-borne disease—and presenting it in a way that is grounded in data and accessible to non-specialists.

## Why I Chose This Topic

As a biotechnology student, I’ve always been drawn to topics that sit at the intersection of <strong>science, climate, and public health</strong>.  
Vector-borne diseases—especially <strong>West Nile virus</strong>—depend heavily on environmental conditions such as temperature and moisture.

Studying how these patterns shift in a warming climate felt both scientifically meaningful and personally relevant.  
It also offered a chance to practice real-world data analysis that aligns with my long-term career path in science.

## A Capstone-Style Project

Although completed within a single course, this work was designed as a <strong>mini capstone</strong>:

- Identifying a real, socially relevant question  
- Collecting and cleaning climate and disease datasets  
- Building a reproducible workflow in R  
- Creating visuals that explain complex ideas simply  
- Designing a public-facing product others can navigate and learn from  

A separate written paper provides the full analysis, while this website focuses on <strong>communication</strong>—the part meant for students, instructors, and community members.

## Why Utah?

Utah is where I live and study, and it has unique climate patterns:  
long-term drought, sharp temperature swings, changing precipitation, and increasing heat extremes.

These conditions shape mosquito activity and influence West Nile virus risk.  
Including a Utah-specific section helps connect national trends to a local, familiar landscape.

## Tools and Skills Used

This project was built using:

- <strong>R</strong> for data wrangling, visualization, and analysis  
- <strong>R Markdown</strong> for combining text, code, and graphics  
- <strong>tidyverse</strong> packages for data cleaning  
- <strong>ggplot2</strong> for visualizations  
- <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> for hosting the site  
- Climate datasets from <strong>NOAA</strong>  
- Disease datasets from the <strong>CDC</strong> West Nile surveillance system  

Completing the full workflow—from raw data to polished website—strengthened my data science, communication, and project-building skills.

## How to Navigate This Site

Each tab walks through part of the project:

- <strong>Climate Trends</strong> – long-term climate changes  
- <strong>Disease Trends</strong> – West Nile virus patterns  
- <strong>Climate–Disease Comparison</strong> – climate and disease side-by-side  
- <strong>Utah Focus</strong> – state-level climate and disease trends  
- <strong>How to Read These Graphs</strong> – help interpreting visuals  
- <strong>Methods</strong> – how the data was cleaned and analyzed  
- <strong>Reflection</strong> – what I learned along the way  

You can explore the pages in order or jump directly into the sections that interest you.

## Project Limitations & Transparency

This work reflects the scope of an <strong>undergraduate exploratory project</strong>.  
It uses publicly available data, simple methods, and focuses on <strong>patterns</strong> rather than predictions.

My goal is <strong>clarity and transparency</strong> rather than forecasting or policy-making.  
All code and steps are visible throughout the site to support reproducibility.

## About the Author

My name is <strong>Garrett Warr</strong>, and I’m an undergraduate student at Utah Valley University studying <strong>Biotechnology</strong>.  
I’m interested in how climate, health, and the environment connect — especially how changing conditions influence diseases, ecosystems, and the communities we live in.

Alongside this project, my studies focus on:

- Public health  
- Microbiology and molecular biology  
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Climate science and environmental change  

I enjoy building clear, visual, reproducible work using tools like <strong>R</strong>, <strong>ggplot2</strong>, and <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>.  
This project is part of my broader goal to grow as a scientist who can communicate complex ideas simply and effectively.
