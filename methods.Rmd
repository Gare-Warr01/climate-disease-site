## Overview of the Methods

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
This project was built to be <strong>transparent, reproducible, and easy to follow</strong>.  
Every graph, table, and comparison on this website comes from a clear, step-by-step workflow in R that someone else could recreate.

## Data Sources

To explore how climate conditions relate to mosquito-borne disease, this project draws from two major groups of datasets.

### **Climate Data**
- Sourced from NOAA climate summaries.  
- Includes <strong>temperature</strong>, <strong>precipitation</strong>, and <strong>drought indices</strong> such as PDSI.  
- Aggregated to the <strong>state–year</strong> level for consistent national comparison.

### **Disease Data**
- Built from human case data for <strong>West Nile virus (WNV)</strong> from CDC public health surveillance.  
- Includes reported cases per <strong>state</strong> and <strong>year</strong>.  
- Focuses on long-term, national patterns rather than short-term outbreaks.

All datasets were used strictly for <strong>educational purposes</strong> in GEOG 3000.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

All data cleaning was performed in R using the <strong>tidyverse</strong>.

Key steps included:

- Importing CSVs with <code>readr</code>  
- Standardizing column names for readability  
- Filtering to valid states and meaningful years  
- Checking for missing or inconsistent values  
- Removing invalid observations (e.g., negative case counts)  
- Creating tidy, analysis-ready tables  

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
One of the biggest lessons here: <strong>real-world data is imperfect</strong>, and careful cleaning is essential for honest analysis.

## Combining Climate & Disease Data

To make meaningful comparisons, the datasets needed to align.

This involved:

- Standardizing state abbreviations  
- Ensuring matching year formats  
- Creating a shared <strong>state–year</strong> joining key  
- Using <code>dplyr::left_join()</code> to merge climate indicators with WNV case counts  

The unified dataset supports the visuals throughout:

- <strong>Climate Trends</strong>  
- <strong>Disease Trends</strong>  
- <strong>Climate–Disease Comparison</strong>  
- <strong>Utah Focus</strong>  

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
The goal was not prediction, but to create a clean structure where <strong>visual patterns</strong> could be explored with confidence.

## Visualization & Analysis in R

All graphs were created using <strong>ggplot2</strong>, chosen for its clear, consistent visual style.

The project uses:

- <strong>Line charts</strong> for long-term climate and disease trends  
- <strong>Faceted plots</strong> for comparing states  
- <strong>Paired or overlayed visuals</strong> to explore climate–disease relationships  
- Clean color palettes for accessibility  

This project emphasizes:

- Visual storytelling  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Clear communication  

Readers should be able to interpret trends without needing advanced statistical training.

## Reproducibility & Workflow

A major priority was ensuring this project was reproducible.

This was supported by:

- Building each page in <strong>R Markdown</strong>  
- Keeping explanations and code together  
- Using self-updating graphics that knit automatically  
- Hosting the entire project on <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>  
- Maintaining a clear and traceable workflow  

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
Reproducibility is not just a coding goal — it’s a commitment to scientific clarity and transparency.

## Analytical Choices & Limitations

This project uses <strong>descriptive and visual analysis</strong> rather than predictive modeling.  
This choice keeps the results accessible and avoids overstating what the datasets can support.

Limitations include:

- Differences in reporting practices between states  
- Possible under-reporting of human WNV cases  
- Occasional gaps or inconsistencies in climate data  
- State-level aggregation that cannot capture city-level variation  

These limitations do not prevent meaningful exploration — they simply frame how the trends should be interpreted.

## Software & Versioning

To support reproducibility, all work was completed using:

- <strong>R</strong> (version 4.x)  
- <strong>RStudio</strong>  
- <strong>tidyverse</strong>  
- <strong>ggplot2</strong>  
- <strong>knitr</strong> and <strong>rmarkdown</strong> for site rendering  

Using consistent versions ensures that graphs and results remain stable over time.
