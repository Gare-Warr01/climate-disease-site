> *“Climate doesn’t just change averages. It shifts the conditions that diseases depend on.”*

This site is my undergraduate capstone-style project on **climate change and vector-borne disease** in the United States, with a special focus on **West Nile virus** and a **spotlight on Utah**, where I live and study.

Using real climate and disease datasets, I explore a central guiding question:

> **How is a warming, shifting climate shaping the risk of mosquito-borne disease in the U.S., and what might that mean for places like Utah?**

---

## Overview

This website brings together **climate records**, **public-health surveillance data**, and a **reproducible R workflow** to explore three connected pieces:

- **Climate trends** – how temperature, precipitation, and drought indicators have changed over time.
- **Disease trends** – especially **West Nile virus**, one of the most widespread mosquito-borne diseases in the U.S.
- **Climate–disease comparisons** – where patterns in climate and disease appear to move together in ways that might matter.

The goal is **not** to prove strict cause-and-effect. Instead, this project:

- Looks for **patterns and correlations** that raise good questions.
- Practices **transparent, reproducible analysis** in R.
- Connects what we learned in **GEOG 3000: Climate Change in Science and Society** to real-world data.
- Creates a **professional, portfolio-ready project** that communicates clearly to non-specialists.

## Why This Matters

Vector-borne diseases like West Nile virus are tightly linked to environmental conditions:

- Mosquitoes depend on **temperature, moisture, and standing water**.
- **Warmer temperatures** can extend mosquito seasons and expand their geographic range.
- **Changing precipitation and drought patterns** affect where mosquitoes breed and how often people and vectors come into contact.

As the climate warms and weather patterns shift, public health agencies, researchers, and communities need to understand how **climate change** might influence **disease risk**—and where vulnerabilities could grow.

This project is a small, student-level step in that direction: an example of how climate and disease data can be combined to start asking **informed questions** about risk in a changing climate.

## Core Research Questions

This project is built around three simple but important questions:

1. **How is the U.S. climate changing over time?**  
2. **How are vector-borne diseases—especially West Nile virus—changing across space and time?**  
3. **Do climate and disease patterns appear to move together in ways that might matter for public health, especially in Utah?**

Each tab on this site helps answer part of these questions.

## Project Context: GEOG 3000 Final Project

This website is the **applied, public-facing product** for my final project in  
**GEOG 3000: Climate Change in Science and Society** at Utah Valley University.

For this assignment, students are asked to:

- Focus on a **specific aspect of climate change** and its impacts on society.  
- Use **reputable data sources** (e.g., NOAA, CDC, EPA) and documented methods.  
- Develop a **professional-quality applied product** such as a website, report, or tool.  
- Present findings and explain the **data, methods, and limitations**.  
- Reflect on how the project supports **academic and professional goals**.

In my case:

- The formal **research and analysis paper** is written separately.  
- This **website** is the applied component that communicates the work to a broader audience.  
- Additional personal context and reflection appear on the **About This Project** and **Reflection** pages.

When you explore this site, you are seeing the **communication side** of the project—the part designed to make climate–disease connections understandable and visually clear.

## Project Goals

More specifically, this site aims to:

- **Combine** climate and disease datasets into a single analysis workflow in R.  
- **Visualize** long-term climate trends across the United States and selected regions.  
- **Examine** patterns in vector-borne disease (especially West Nile virus) over space and time.  
- **Compare** climate indicators and disease outcomes to see where interesting relationships appear.  
- **Document** the workflow so that, in principle, someone else could reproduce or extend the analysis.

These goals match the course emphasis on **science, society, and communication**—not just running numbers, but making them meaningful.

## Data Overview

This project draws on several cleaned datasets stored as CSV files and read directly into R.

### Climate Data

Climate-related datasets include:

- Annual and/or seasonal **temperature** records  
- **Precipitation** data  
- **Drought indicators**, such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)  
- State-level or regional summaries, depending on availability  

These datasets allow us to see how climate variables have changed over time and how those changes differ across space.

### Disease Data

Disease-related datasets include:

- Reported cases of **West Nile virus** from CDC and related surveillance sources  
- Data aggregated by **year** and **state**, so we can explore both temporal and spatial patterns  

Together, the climate and disease datasets form the backbone of the visualizations and comparisons on this site.  
Details on each dataset—including sources, key variables, and cleaning steps—are documented on the **Data** and **Methods** pages.

## What You’ll Find on This Site

Use the navigation bar at the top of the page to move through the project:

- **Home** – Big-picture overview of the project and why climate–disease connections matter.  
- **Data** – Descriptions of each dataset and the variables used in the analysis.  
- **Methods** – High-level explanation of how the data were cleaned, combined, and analyzed in R.  
- **Climate Trends** – Plots and summaries showing how key climate variables have changed over time in the U.S. and selected areas.  
- **Disease Trends** – Visualizations of vector-borne disease patterns (especially West Nile virus) across space and time.  
- **Climate–Disease Comparison** – Exploratory comparisons that place climate indicators and disease outcomes side by side.  
- **Utah Focus** – A closer look at climate and disease patterns relevant to Utah.  
- **How to Read These Graphs** – A gentle guide for anyone who feels “not great at graphs,” explaining how to interpret the visuals.  
- **About This Project** – Background about me, the course, and how this project fits into my academic and professional goals.  
- **Reflection** – Personal reflection on what I learned about climate, health, data, and uncertainty.  
- **References** – Data sources and key supporting materials.

Each page is designed to stand on its own so visitors can drop in anywhere and still understand what they are seeing.

## What This Project Can and Cannot Do

Because this is an **exploratory undergraduate project**, there are clear limits.

### What It Cannot Do

- It does **not** prove causal relationships between climate and disease.  
- It uses **relatively simple** methods (summaries, visualizations, and introductory modeling tools).  
- It does **not** attempt detailed forecasting, risk mapping, or policy modeling at a professional level.

### What It Can Do

- Provide a **clear, organized view** of climate and disease datasets in one place.  
- Highlight **patterns and relationships** that may be worth deeper study.  
- Demonstrate a **transparent, reproducible R-based workflow** that could be expanded with more advanced methods in future work.

This site is meant to be approachable: something that students, instructors, and interested visitors can explore without needing a background in advanced statistics—while still staying grounded in real data and careful methods.
