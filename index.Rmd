## Welcome

Welcome to my undergraduate project on **climate change and vector-borne disease** in the United States.\
This site pulls together climate datasets and public-health surveillance records to explore a central question:

> **How is a warming, shifting climate shaping the risk of mosquito-borne diseases in the U.S.?**

The project focuses on national patterns, with a special spotlight on **Utah**, where I live and study.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What This Project Is About

This website brings together real data and reproducible R code to explore three connected pieces:

-   **Climate trends** – how temperature, precipitation, and drought have changed over time.\
-   **Disease trends** – especially **West Nile virus**, one of the most widespread mosquito-borne diseases in the U.S.\
-   **Climate–disease comparisons** – places where these patterns might move together.

I am not trying to prove a strict cause-and-effect relationship. Instead, the project is designed to:

-   Explore **patterns and correlations** that raise good questions.\
-   Practice **transparent, reproducible analysis** in R.\
-   Connect what we learned in **GEOG 3000: Climate Change in Science and Society** to real-world data.\
-   Create a **professional, portfolio-ready project** that communicates clearly to non-specialists.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Core Questions

At its heart, this project asks three simple but important questions:

1.  **How is the U.S. climate changing over time?**\
2.  **How are vector-borne diseases—especially West Nile virus—changing across space and time?**\
3.  **Do these climate and disease patterns appear to move together in ways that might matter for public health?**

Each tab on this site helps answer part of these questions.

## Project Context: GEOG 3000 Applied Final Project

This website is the applied portion of my final project for\
**GEOG 3000: Climate Change in Science and Society**.

For this assignment, students are asked to:

-   Focus on a **specific aspect of climate change** and its impacts on society.\
-   Use **reputable data sources** (e.g., NOAA, EPA, CDC) and documented methods.\
-   Develop a **professional-quality applied product** such as a website, report, or tool.\
-   Present findings and be able to explain the data, methods, and limitations.\
-   Reflect on how the project supports **academic and professional goals**.

In my case:

-   The formal **research and analysis paper** is written separately.\
-   This **website** serves as the applied, public-facing product.\
-   Reflection and personal background appear on the **About** page.

When you explore this site, you are seeing the communication side of the project—the part designed to make climate–disease connections understandable and visually clear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why This Matters

Vector-borne diseases like West Nile virus are closely tied to environmental conditions:

-   Mosquitoes depend on **temperature, moisture, and standing water**.\
-   **Warmer temperatures** can extend mosquito seasons and expand their geographic range.\
-   **Changing precipitation and drought patterns** affect where mosquitoes breed and how often people and vectors come into contact.

As the climate warms and weather patterns shift, public health agencies, researchers, and communities need to understand how **changes in climate** may influence **disease risk**.

This project is a small, student-level step in that direction—an example of how climate and disease data can be combined to begin asking informed questions about risk in a changing climate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Goals

More specifically, this site aims to:

-   **Combine** climate and disease datasets into a single analysis workflow.\
-   **Visualize** long-term climate trends across the United States.\
-   **Examine** patterns in vector-borne disease (especially West Nile virus) over space and time.\
-   **Compare** climate indicators and disease outcomes to see where interesting relationships might appear.\
-   **Document** the R workflow so that, in principle, someone else could reproduce or extend the analysis.

Later pages also begin to explore **simple models and basic forecasting**, using tools like trend lines, linear models, and time-series methods to see how climate and disease patterns might be related and how they might change in the near future.

These goals match the course emphasis on **science, society, and communication**—not just running numbers, but making them meaningful.

## Data Overview

This project draws on several cleaned datasets stored as CSV files and read directly into R.

### Climate Data

Climate-related datasets include:

-   Annual and/or seasonal **temperature** records\
-   **Precipitation** data\
-   **Drought indicators**, such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)\
-   State-level or regional summaries, depending on availability

These datasets allow us to look at how climate variables have changed over time and how those changes differ across space.

### Disease Data

Disease-related datasets include:

-   Reported cases of **West Nile virus** from CDC and related surveillance sources\
-   Data aggregated by **year** and **state**, so we can explore both temporal and spatial patterns

Together, the climate and disease datasets form the backbone of the visualizations and comparisons on this site.

Details on each dataset—including sources, key variables, and cleaning steps—are documented on the **Data & Methods** page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What You Will See on This Site

Use the navigation bar at the top of the page to move through the project:

-   **Home** – Big-picture overview of the project and why climate–disease connections matter.\
-   **Data & Methods** – Descriptions of each dataset, how they were cleaned, and the basic R workflow.\
-   **Climate Trends** – Plots and summaries showing how key climate variables have changed over time in the U.S. and selected areas.\
-   **Disease Trends** – Visualizations of vector-borne disease patterns (especially West Nile virus) across space and time.\
-   **Comparisons** – Exploratory comparisons and simple models that look at climate variables and disease outcomes together, including basic forecasting.\
-   **About** – Background about me, this course, and how the project fits into my academic and professional goals.

Each page is designed to be readable on its own, so visitors can drop in anywhere and still understand what they are seeing.

## What This Project Can and Cannot Do

Because this is an **exploratory undergraduate project**, there are some clear limits.

### What It Cannot Do

-   It does **not** prove causal relationships between climate and disease.\
-   It uses **relatively simple methods** (summaries, visualizations, linear models, and basic time-series tools).\
-   It does **not** attempt detailed forecasting, risk mapping, or policy modeling at a professional level.

### What It Can Do

-   Provide a **clear, organized view** of climate and disease datasets in one place.\
-   Highlight **patterns and relationships** that may be worth deeper study.\
-   Demonstrate a **transparent, reproducible R-based workflow** that could be expanded with more advanced methods in future work.

This site is meant to be approachable: something that students, instructors, and interested visitors can explore without needing a background in advanced statistics, but still grounded in real data and careful methods.
