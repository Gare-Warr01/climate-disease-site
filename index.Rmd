## Welcome

Welcome to my undergraduate project on **climate change and vector-borne disease** in the United States.\
This site brings together climate data and disease data to ask a basic but important question:

> How might a warming, changing climate affect the risk of diseases carried by mosquitoes and other vectors?

While the focus is national, I highlight **Utah** where possible, since that’s where I live and study.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What This Project Is About

This project uses real datasets and simple statistical tools in R to explore how:

-   **Climate patterns** (like temperature, precipitation, and drought) are changing over time.
-   **Vector-borne diseases** (like West Nile virus) vary across states and years.
-   These patterns might **relate to each other**, even in basic, exploratory ways.

The goal is **not** to “prove” a causal relationship, but to:

-   Look for **patterns and correlations**.
-   Practice **transparent, reproducible analysis** in R.
-   Build a foundation for thinking about how climate and health are connected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why This Matters

Vector-borne diseases depend heavily on environmental conditions:

-   Mosquitoes and other vectors are sensitive to **temperature**, **moisture**, and **standing water**.
-   **Warmer temperatures** can lengthen mosquito seasons or expand where they can survive.
-   **Drought and precipitation** can change where and how people and vectors interact.

As climate change continues, public health agencies, researchers, and communities need to understand how **shifts in climate** might change **disease risk**.\
This project is a small, student-level step toward exploring that connection with real data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Goals

More specifically, this site aims to:

-   **Combine** climate and disease datasets in one place.
-   **Visualize** long-term climate trends across the U.S.
-   **Examine** trends in vector-borne diseases over time and space.
-   **Compare** climate conditions and disease patterns to see where interesting relationships might appear.
-   **Practice** clear, documented R workflows so anyone could, in theory, rerun the analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Overview

This project uses several types of data, including:

-   **Climate data**
    -   Temperature (annual and seasonal patterns)\
    -   Precipitation and drought indicators\
    -   In some cases, state- or region-level summaries
-   **Disease data**
    -   Reported cases of vector-borne diseases (especially West Nile virus)\
    -   Aggregated by year and location (e.g., state-level)

All data are cleaned and saved as **CSV files** so they can be easily loaded into R. Details on each dataset, including sources and cleaning steps, are described on the **Data & Methods** page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How the Site Is Organized

Use the navigation bar at the top of the page to move through the project:

-   **Home** – You are here. Big-picture overview of the project and why it matters.
-   **Data & Methods** – Descriptions of each dataset, how they were cleaned, and the basic R workflow.
-   **Climate Trends** – Plots and summaries of how climate variables have changed over time in the U.S.
-   **Disease Trends** – Visualizations of vector-borne disease patterns (where and when cases occur).
-   **Comparisons** – Simple comparisons and exploratory models looking at climate variables and disease outcomes together.
-   **About** – A short section about me and the context of this project (undergraduate work for a climate change course).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What This Project Can and Cannot Do

This is an **exploratory student project**, so it has some limits:

-   It does **not** establish causal relationships between climate and disease.
-   It uses relatively **simple methods** (summaries, plots, basic models).
-   It focuses on clarity and transparency rather than advanced modeling.

What it **does** offer is:

-   A clear, organized look at climate and disease datasets.
-   A starting point for thinking about how climate change could influence vector-borne disease risk.
-   A reproducible R-based workflow that could be extended in future work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Next Steps

As I continue working on this project, I may:

-   Refine the datasets or add new climate indicators.
-   Try slightly more advanced models.
-   Add more state-level or region-specific examples, including Utah.

For now, feel free to click through the pages, explore the plots, and see how climate and disease data can be brought together in one place.
