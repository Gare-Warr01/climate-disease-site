<em>“Learning is not just about mastering concepts — it’s about discovering who you become through the work.”</em>

This project challenged me in ways that felt both academic and personal.  
It pushed me to bring together climate science, disease ecology, data analysis, and communication — and to build something meaningful from start to finish.  
It showed me that when data, purpose, and clarity come together, science becomes something people can truly engage with.

## What I Learned About Climate and Society

Before this course, most of my understanding of climate change came from the scientific side — greenhouse gases, warming trends, seasonal shifts, and datasets.  
GEOG 3000 introduced a new layer: the <strong>human story</strong>.

I learned that:

- Climate change doesn’t affect everyone equally  
- Vulnerability depends on wealth, location, infrastructure, and history  
- Environmental shifts show up in public health long before they appear in policy  
- Data is only useful if people can understand it  

This project helped me see climate change not as a distant scientific issue, but as something that shapes daily life, health risks, and future choices.  
It connected the science to the society that lives inside it.

## Growth in Data Skills and Scientific Communication

This was the most technically challenging part of the course — and also where I grew the most.

I strengthened my ability to:

- Clean messy, imperfect real-world datasets  
- Combine multiple sources into a unified workflow  
- Debug errors I didn’t expect  
- Build visualizations people can actually interpret  
- Host a public-facing website from scratch  
- Document each step so everything was reproducible  

I also learned how to balance <strong>accuracy</strong> with <strong>accessibility</strong> — something that matters deeply in public health and climate communication.

The biggest shift was realizing that data is not the end of the process.  
It’s the beginning of a conversation.

## How This Project Supports My Professional Development

As a biotechnology student preparing for a career in research, lab work, and data-driven science, this project became a surprising bridge between disciplines.

It helped me grow in:

- <strong>Analytical thinking</strong> — making sense of environmental and disease patterns  
- <strong>Technical skill</strong> — using R, ggplot2, and GitHub Pages  
- <strong>Communication</strong> — translating complex ideas into clear visuals  
- <strong>Professional independence</strong> — working through an entire project lifecycle  

These skills are essential whether I end up in microbiology, epidemiology, data analysis, or broader biotech research.

This project wasn’t just classwork — it felt like a preview of the kind of scientific problem-solving I want to do in my career.

## Leveraging This Project for My Future Career

Because this site is hosted publicly, it becomes a direct part of my professional identity.

I can use this project to:

- <strong>Show employers</strong> my ability to work with real, complex datasets  
- Demonstrate that I can build <strong>reproducible workflows</strong>  
- Provide a polished example of my <strong>data visualization</strong> skills  
- Highlight my interest in <strong>climate health, epidemiology, and biotechnology</strong>  
- Strengthen interviews by discussing a real-world project with measurable skills  
- Link directly to it on my <strong>resume</strong>, <strong>LinkedIn</strong>, and <strong>applications</strong>  

In biotech and research roles, employers want proof that you can take a problem, break it down, analyze it, and communicate it.

This website is that proof.

## Key Takeaways From This Project

<div style="padding:12px 16px; background-color:#ffffff; border:1px solid #e1e1e1; border-radius:4px;">

- Climate change isn’t just environmental — it’s a public health issue.  
- Communicating science clearly is as important as running the analysis.  
- Real datasets are messy, but they teach you more than perfect examples ever could.  
- Reproducibility matters — both for credibility and future growth.  
- I’m capable of building full analytical projects from scratch.  
- This field — where climate, environment, and disease intersect — is something I want to explore more deeply in my career.

## Looking Ahead

This project made climate change feel personal.  
It made public health feel urgent.  
And it made scientific communication feel meaningful.

As I move forward in my studies and career, I want to continue:

- Asking questions that matter  
- Working with real-world data  
- Building projects that serve a purpose  
- Strengthening my communication skills  
- Staying curious about how biology and climate shape each other  

This project reminded me why I chose science in the first place:  
to understand the world more deeply, and to help people make sense of it too.

## A Personal Note

This was one of the first projects where I felt genuinely proud of the work — not just because it was finished, but because it meant something.  
It taught me patience, problem-solving, persistence, and the value of presenting science clearly.

More than anything, it helped me see the kind of scientist I’m becoming:  
someone who values data, clarity, curiosity, and the connection between people and the planet.
